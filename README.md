## Installation

To build the packages, you need a scratchbox environment set up. See
the Nokia/Maemo documentation for information on how to do this. To
build the package, go to the Jamaendo source directory and type

    make build-package

This will (hopefully) generate a .deb file for you to install on your
Maemo 5 device.

## Optification

The package is optified. It will install datafiles to `/opt/jamaendo`,
and saves cached data and settings in `~/MyDocs/.jamaendo`.

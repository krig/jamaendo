## Installation

To build the packages, you need a scratchbox environment set up. See
the Nokia/Maemo documentation for information on how to do this. To
build the package, go to the Jamaendo source directory and type

    make build-package

This will (hopefully) generate a .deb file for you to install on your
Maemo 5 device.

## Optification

If you're running a newer release of the Fremantle platform, this step
may not (I hope not!) be necessary, but either way: The package that
the build process produces is not entirely optified. It is compatible
with the `maemo-optify` tool, however. All you need to do is run
`maemo-optify-deb` on the generated .deb file.
